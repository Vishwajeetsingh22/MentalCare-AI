MentalCare AI - Context-Aware Conversational AI Wellness Chat Engine
Academic Project: MCA Mobile Application Development (Continuous Assessment)
Team: Group 11 (Joylyn Princita Fernandes, Syed Faizan Pasha, Vishwajeet Singh)
Department of MCA, Jain (Deemed-to-be University)

Architecture:
1. Multi-turn Conversational Memory: Maintains stateful conversation context across turns per conversation_id.
2. External AI Provider Support: Native Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash / gemini-2.5-flash) and OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini).
3. Dynamic Dialogue Context Engine: Extracts user entities (stress, exams, mathematics, sleep difficulties),
   answers direct queries (e.g. "What did I tell you about my exams?"), handles affirmations ("Yes ask me questions"),
   and generates tailored wellness & study plans without static canned repetition.
4. Crisis Safety Guardrails: Immediate de-escalation for self-harm ideation, flags is_crisis=True, 988 lifeline.
5. Medical Boundary Enforcement: Disclaims clinical diagnosis authority, rejects prescriptions, refers to licensed professionals.

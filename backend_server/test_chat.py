"""
MentalCare AI - Chatbot Multi-Turn Verification Test Suite
Verifies the exact 7-step conversation sequence from Step 8:
Turn 1: "I'm feeling stressed today."
Turn 2: "Yes ask me questions."
Turn 3: "My exams are tomorrow."
Turn 4: "I haven't studied mathematics."
Turn 5: "Can you help me make a study plan?"
Turn 6: "I am also having trouble sleeping."
Turn 7: "What did I tell you about my exams?"

Additional Tests:
- Empty message validation
- Crisis ideation de-escalation
- Medical diagnosis rejection

## ℹ️ Important Wellness Disclaimer & Responsible AI
**MentalCare AI** is engineered strictly as an **assistive wellness and early-warning support application**, not a clinical medical diagnostic tool. It does NOT diagnose clinical depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, or psychiatric illnesses. The AI estimates stress trends to encourage mindful lifestyle balance, stress awareness, healthy habits, and timely referral to trusted friends or qualified healthcare professionals.

## 🌐 External AI Provider Configuration (Part 26)

If an external AI provider (such as Google Gemini) is used:

1. **AI Provider:** **Google Gemini API** (Recommended: model `gemini-1.5-flash`).
2. **Where to Create Key:** Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
3. **Where to Place Key:** On your backend server only in:
   `backend_server/.env`
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyYourActualKeyHere
   ```
4. **Environment Variable:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
5. **How to Test:**
   ```powershell
   py backend_server/test_chat.py
   ```
*Security Guarantee:* The API key is **never** embedded inside the Android application. Android communicates exclusively with the backend via `POST /chat`.
